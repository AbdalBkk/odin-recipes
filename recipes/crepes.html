        <p>I love this recipe because it is so simple to make. I have made it healthier by substituting whole wheat flour and 1% milk. I like to fill them with non-fat plain Greek yogurt and blueberries warmed in maple syrup. Yum!</p>
        
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <p>Here are the ingredients you will need to make this recipe.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup white whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>½ cup low-fat (1%) milk</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together flour and eggs in a large mixing bowl. Gradually add milk and water, stirring to combine. Mix in butter and salt and beat until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop 1/4 cup batter onto griddle. Tilt pan with a circular motion so batter coats the surface evenly. </li>
            <li>Cook crepe until bottom is light brown, about 2 minutes. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook other side. Serve hot with yogurt, maple syrup, and blueberries. </li>
